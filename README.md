## Case Study: Trajectory Data Analysis

**Team members:** Kylie Greenwald, May Fu, Grace Liu, Elise Zhang

**Compilation instructions:** 
Imported packages include `math`, `queue`, `heapq`, `time`, `csv`, `random`, and `matplotlib`. `matplotlib` is the only package that requires downloading, if any. For downloading instructions, visit [this link](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html).

**Execution instructions:**
Tasks are separated by files. To execute the code, simply visit the file with the method you are testing and run the code in its entirety.

**File Organization:**
The files are associated with each task as follows:

**Part 1: Task 1:**
- The density(p) and hubs(P, k, r) procedures are located in hubs.py

**Part 1: Task 2:**
- The d(q, e) procedure is located in epsilon.py
- The TS-greedy(T, e) procedure is located in tsGreedy.py

**Part 1: Task 3:**
- The dtw(P, Q) procedure is located in dtw.py
- The fd(P, Q) procedure is located in frechetDistance.py

**Part 2: Task 4:**
- The center_approach_1(trajectories, pts_dict) is located in center.py
- The center_approach_2(trajectories, pts_dict) is located in center.py

**Part 2: Task 5:**
- The lloyds_algorithm(traj_dict, k, t_max, seed_method) is located in cluster.py
- The random_seeding(traj_dict, k) and proposed_seeding(traj_dict, k) is located in cluster.py
